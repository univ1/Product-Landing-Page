						<p class="review review-top">You wouldn't believe how much fun the Phem-Bot is! Growing up, I was never a big fan of toys or robots, but I got my hands on one of these
						when my colleague brought it to work. Suffice it to say that I've been converted. Toys for life!</p>

						<p class="review review-top">For those adults among you who think you've outgrown toys, you haven't. Well maybe you have, but the Phem-Bot is hardly a toy. I honestly
						didn't expect such futuristic technology to be so widely available on the market until 2050 or so. If you're on the fence, get one now!</p>

						<p class="review-top">Hands down, the best toy ever! My best friend begged her parents to get her one as a high-school graduation present, and when they did,
						our lives changed. I eventually got my own, but for weeks, we would spend our afternoons learning Chinese and improving at darts with her Phem-Bot.
						Now that we have two between us, it's twice as fun!</p>

						<p class="review">My grandmother is 97 years old and such a sweet soul. Our family bought her a Phem-Bot for Christmas and she adored it from the start.
						Her favorite game was the balloon popping one, and watching her play was one of the most adorable things I've ever seen. We didn't even know that there were
						add-ons you could buy to expand the Phem-Bot. Thanks to the Phem-Bot, we shared many precious moments with grandma that we'll never forget.</p>

						<p class="review">Ten out of ten! I've never had so much fun in my entire life. The brick breaking game is so addicting that it's invading my dreams.
						The music is just sooo good! I highly recommend the Phem-Bot and the scaffolding add-on to anybody who enjoys having fun.</p>

						<p class="review">What a neat toy! I've been obsessed with toys since I was a little baby, and I really thought that nothing would surpass last year's
						Wonderman toy for at least a few years. Boy, was I wrong... The Phem-Bot is a must-have toy for any toy enthusiast, and it's even a great first toy
						to get non-toy-lovers on board. It has so much functionality that it's practically all you'll ever need.</p>
